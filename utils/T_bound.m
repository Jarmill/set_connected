function [bound] = T_bound(n, d, r)
%T_BOUND maximum length of geodesic path connecting two points in a 
%semialgebraic set. This set is defined by an n-variate polynomial f(x)>=0
% where f has degree d, contained within the ball with radius r

%based on results from 
% Didier Dâ€™Acunto and Krzysztof Kurdyka Bounds for gradient trajectories of definable 
%functions with applications to robotics and semialgebraic geometry.
